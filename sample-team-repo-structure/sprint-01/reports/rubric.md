## Content

The deliverable will be a single file named **sprint-01.md** located in a folder named **sprint-01** under the **reports** folder in your team GitHub repo.

Report will include the entire Application or user story delivered in screenshots or mock-ups.  There will be two to three stories:

- The User story
  - Show how a user will interact with and use your site
- The Admin Story
  - Show how an admin user will interact with and use your site
- If applicable, show how an unauthenticated user will interact with your site

These *screens* will be generated by you by a tool of choice, hand drawn on paper and scanned are not acceptable artifacts.

## Individual Deliverables

This story will weave together the contributions of each team member into a single narrative.

### UI/UX

Explain the team choice of setup and UI/UX displayed,  Use references from previous classes or cite comparable existing websites.  Explain any features of the applications as well (mobile, assistive technology, etc, etc)

### Developer

Explain why the team chose the type of language framework they did.  Explain where this framework is used in existing commercial applications and any benefits of the language framework.

### Junior Developer and Security

Explain any security assumptions made about the application in regards to security, encryption, firewalls, authentication mechanisms, and any others items you see fit. This job is for teams with 5 people and will be rolled into the UI/UX role if the team has 4 people.

### Operating Systems and IT Infrastructure

Explain the choice of operating systems and platforms.  Explain datastore choice as well as demonstrate the SQL schema for the database you will implement based on the UI/UX drawings

### Project Manager

Will set initial tasks and timelines using a project management tool, displaying projected progress and actual goals accomplished.  They Will gather the contributed portions into a single narrative (be careful just copying and pasting) -- see the template.md for a standard template.   They will give the presentation to their lab class based on their accomplishments

## Deliverable

The Project Manager will submit the URL to the sprint-01.md on GitHub, it will be a group submission so only one is needed.  Don't forget!
